# StudyBuddy

StudyBuddy Exchange is a website where people can learn together and also teach each other. Its not needed to be a student — this platform is for everyone who wants to study something new.

Example:
A math teacher wants to learn how to draw.
An artist wants to improve their math skills.
They can find each other, join the same group, and help each other learn.
Users can join study groups, chat in real-time, and share knowledge.

What can people do on this platform?
Create an account and log in
Make a profile and describe: what you can teach and what you want to learn.
Create or join study groups (for example “Basic Physics”, “Learn Python Together”)
Chat with people in your group
Share knowledge and maybe plan video calls
Developers can use a REST API to get data from the platform (in JSON)

User Stories (short tasks and ideas)
As a new user, I want to sign up and log in to the platform.
As a user, I want to describe what I can teach and what I want to learn.

Technical Requirements

User accounts and login (authentication)
